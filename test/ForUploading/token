key code sh.pycharm.sh

so fo unknow time of arguement we use int... name

and to loop throoug it we do for(name : name)
u think that dut is in like python

turns out you can actually do cal.namess(new int [] {23, 2,3 5, 6,})
and you pass in an array straight

and it is called variable lenght arguement




Enums
enums are special class that hold constants

so to define an enum u do 
public enum days{
constant should be in capital 
enums are public static and finals



in a method take in two arg the first arg is an array and the second arg is a number


in a way loop pick the fisr one if state after three character 

just us a multidimen array
or use a multidimen list
the second parameter is how you want to divide the array

try python list
write a funtion {"A", "M", "C", "W ","I", "T"};
and after two character swap the next character with the skiped  


i mean the index of age[3] creating two list swaping after saving the neede in different list after a condition

AWMICT

use if i <= 3 3 divide i
and if i >3 divide by 3

use the litcode method and use nested and use modulo



what if ypu actually use if statement to seperate the the  so make two loops
