the address of an ibj must be a positive integer, not floating numbers

it becaus array is an obj so when decleard without a size it null

int is a datatype
int array is not a datatype

it turned out that you can create an array obj inout an index of double and cast it in the array eg String n = new String[(int) 3.5]
like this 
and you cannot get index from negative

you can also loop through the array and * it by 2 or any num

and when you print it put it will give you the value you want 

so you can also skip by two while ilterating through the array like printing the oddly place number

eg. for()int i = 0; i < age.lenght; i+=2

the i += 2 is to skip.


task collect 10 scores store in array

first task :
create a 3 by 3 char array;
so like int [] [] score = new int[3] [3];
this is a 3 by 3 arrays and to call  e.g it like [[1,2,3], [1,2,3] [1,2,3]]

task  [[x, o, x], [x, x,x,o], [o,x,x]]

and print it to this form 
x   o   x
x   x   o
o   x   x


eg 
grade [] [] = 8
grade[0] [1] = 5;
grade [1] [0] = 15
so like this i called the array so the outer array index and the inner array index
