slicing 
eg i have nuber = [1, 4, 5, 6, 7,8 9,]
and then i do numbers[2:]
if will start from index two all the way down
[start, stop, step]
[:::]

e.g number[2:4]
this here will start from the index of two and stop at 4
so we have[3,4]

concatinate two list together eg
num [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and
character["c" "d" "g" "h"]
so you do number + character
and you will have[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, "c" "d" "g" "h"]


when you are concatinating a charater the left side must be a list while the right side is an iterable


so to do some id somthing you do id(the list name)

somthing somthing about change id location
