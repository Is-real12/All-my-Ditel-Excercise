somthing about test 
then import unittest as divine -->  this is it an import a name so when ever you need the import you can always call divine😁️

import list_exercise😒️

then create a class 
class TestList(unittest.TestCas): this somthing in the params is called an inheritance 🙄️

or you can do this TestCase in the import so 
from unittest import TestCase --> so right now you are only impporting module that you need 🥱️
 so now let us write a failing test first from unittest import TestCase
so def 🙄️



we can use an orgumented assignment because list is mutable
with the enumerate function i can have access to the index and an iten in the list at the sam etime   list;
e.g for names, age in enumerate(name):
PRINT(F'{NAME} {age}')😁️
()


the fuckin in keyword is to check wheather a particular item is inside a list so (in) turn out there is also not in, since he is🖕️


THE NUMBER OF VAR AT TE LEFT SIDE MUST BE EQUAL TO THE NUM OF VAR AT THE RIGHT SIDE EG😊️

so instaed doing this long journing:
x = tuple[0]
y = tuple[1]
z = tuple[2]


you do-:
X,Y,Z = TURPLE

you can concatinate a turple with  a list;
list are mutable and turple are immutable
so you can concatinae a list to a turple but never a turple to a list. eg
😜️😛️

so to write a tuple you do turple1 = 1, 2, 'DIVINITY'
